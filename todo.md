# TODO
- Create a new homepage for "Trending" items
    - Create another new chart which shows the view trends of latest videos (vs average?)
        - This is views per day for single videos (one trace per video)
            - X = date
            - Y = view count (will be naturally cumulative based on current database content)
    - Show thumbnails for videos that are "Rising" fast (in comments/likes/views)
